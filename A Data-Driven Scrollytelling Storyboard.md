## **Introduction and Rationale**  
I have chosen the theme of online shopping in Canada, focusing on the main perspective of a Canadian shopaholic who has driven into the e-commerce boom after Covid-19. Retail shopping is a widespread topic, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic and during this digital era. In this assignment, I will explore the Canadian shopping trends from 2019 to 2025 and their shopping behaviors. The reason for choosing this topic is based on my story of shopping addiction. During the pandemic, I got used to shopping online and with the help of algorithms, I found a variety of options for the products I need without going out to the store and searching for them. The e-commerce not only saves time for customers but also helps many retailers and small businesses have a closer chance to approach their consumers. I believe this experience has become a trend for shopping ever since.  
## **Method and Dataset selection**  
The visualization storytelling method I choose is Scrollytelling, this method allows the audience to scroll through the story and its visualizations. For the datasets, I collected from various sources, and these data provide quantitative insights into the shift from in-store to online retail since the pandemic. They also show an impact on customer payment behavior. Retail is a commercial topic. There are not many public datasets for me to dive into the deeper aspects. Some of the main dataset sources I collected are as below:
-	Stats Canada – Monthly retail trade e-commerce sales from January 2017 to July 2025  
[Monthly retail trade e-commerce sales](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2010005603)
-	Stats Canada – Historical (real-time) releases of monthly retail trade, sales from January 2017 to July 2025  
[Historical (real-time) releases of monthly retail trade, sales](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2010008101)
-	Stats Canada – Retail e-commerce sales versus in-store sales by subsectors
[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-621-m/11-621-m2023002-eng.htm ](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-621-m/11-621-m2023002-eng.htm)
-	Ecommerce Guide - Top 10 Canadian Ecommerce Sites  
[https://ecommerceguide.com/top/top-10-canadian-ecommerce-sites/ ](https://ecommerceguide.com/top/top-10-canadian-ecommerce-sites/)

I use a line chart to show the trends in retail e-commerce and in-store sales, showing a dramatic increase in the data of Canadian retail e-commerce sales in comparison with retail in-store sales from 2019 to now.  Another line chart is used to show that e-commerce remained a popular option, and which subsector was preferred the most in the online purchase method. Last but not least, a column chart shows the top 10 Canadian E-commerce Sites with their visitors per month in 2024.   
My storyboard can target 3 main audiences: Canadian consumers who are driving into the e-commerce boom and having a related experience; retailers and small businesses who are looking to understand the consumer trends to adapt strategy; undergraduate and master’s students who are studying consumer behaviors after the Covid-19 pandemic.  
## **Iteration 1: Brainstorming**
I have my content generation through some practices on Miro board, where I write down my ideas and interests I found when moving to Canada. As an international student, there are a lot of new things in Canada for me and I want to take closer research about them. Some storyboard ideas I had considered:
-	Payment methods: Contactless payment method trends: NFC and QR – based payments
-	Online retail shopping in Canada: Click and buy

At first, when meeting new friends, I paid attention to the difference in chatting platforms used between domestic and international students. Some messaging apps in Asia countries have their own ecosystems where account holders can link to the mobile wallets. I started to drive into the digital wallet theme, the trend in using contactless payment methods. However, I found that the data for this topic is not complete to make a comparison. Then I linked it to the payment methods customers use when shopping. They both have the same trend after the Covid-19, the transportation from traditional methods to digital methods.

## **Iteration 2: Laying out the foundation**  
While looking for the dataset, I had some ideas for the storyboarding concept and ended up with a decision on scrollytelling approach. I drew out the outline of the idea on my Ipad:

## **Iteration 3: The storyboard**
I made my storyboard on Canva: [Jenny – the shopaholic](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG05Cq5tpM/_1wOxYk1LtOBKIN8g9Cjcg/edit?utm_content=DAG05Cq5tpM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

## **Conclusion**  
This project integrates human-centered storytelling with data to provide a view of online shopping in Canada. By connecting personal narrative to broader shopping trends, I want to inspire the youth, who are our future, to keep pace with the digital trend and apply it to their daily lives. Moreover, through this project, I also encourage entrepreneurs to start their businesses through online platforms, which can help them save operational costs in some aspects.
